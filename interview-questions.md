# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


I'M SO SORRY FOR THESE RESPONSE. I REALLY WAS NOT PREPARED!!!

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: I think the parameters are the walls and what goes inside those walls. You set the limit. An argument is when you pass something through and it gets injected into the code.

  Researched answer: In my experience and the best way for me to explain parameter and argument to you is if I kinda walk you through. You would create parameters and PASS arguments. Parameters are more like vague description that can be anything. Arguments are what you use when you're actively calling on your code. When we are writing our functions we always have placeholders which is what we would generally call the parameter. Arguments would be used when you are calling on that function.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The JavaScript built in method .map iterates through an array and returns an array with the same length. It is extremely helpful when you want to modify an array and keep the length of it. The map takes in three arguments which are value, index and array. Exactly in that order and value is the only on that is required while the other two are optional.

  Researched answer: The JavaScript built in method .map is a non-mutating method. It can create a new array with the given array. The output varies depending on the input and conditions of the code. The one thing that you can expect from .map. The length from the old/new array will not change. The predefined parameters that this method take are value, index, and array. Value is a required parameter, while the other two are only optional. Value holds the value of the current element and index holds the index of the current element.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Both map and filter are a built in method that takes parameters of value, index and array. The main difference between the two methods is that one will return the length shorter than the origin while the other will remain the length intaced. Map will not change the length of the array once it iterates through but filter will on the other hand.

  Researched answer: What I've collected from the internet is that map will go through each element, depending on the conditions of the code and return an altered data while preserving the length. Filter on the other hand will return the same or less amount of elements in array. What it will not do is change the value of the element. In my experience with coding, filter is the better alternative when the expected outcome is choosing a select few from the origin array. Recap, map will modify the elements while returning the same length, filter will choose and pick what to return. In the end, changing the length.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a set of code that you give the computer to execute while method is where there already built in functionality. Both are very important when it comes to coding.

  Researched answer: I feel like both function and method are too similar for me to properly define each and identify the difference. What I do know for certain, is that functions are a block of code that coders write for the computer to execute.  I know that the function gets executed when it is invoked. Once the condition is met within the code block the value is returned. Methods are what can be done on objects. I would say that the main difference from my understanding is that the function can stand on its own while method is attached to an object.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Unfortunately, I get the general idea of object destructuring. It's when you take an object and break it down so that when you call on it you could call on the variable. You create a way where it is easily accessible rather then using dot notation.

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is when you take properties from objects and set them to variables. It's useful when you want to avoid the tedious act of writing out property(ies) with the object and dot notation. When you use object destructuring then you can get pass the extra coding.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I actually have no idea what hoisting is and I'm willing to find out.

  Researched answer: JavaScript Hoisting is when you bring variable, class, and declaration up to the very top of the scope. Hoisting does not work with initialization. From what I'm reading I feel like everyone in my cohort are practicing JavaScript Hoisting without being aware of it. It's a surprise to me that when I read that question, I knew nothing of it. Going through some websites and reading about it I can say that I use it. It's something that you definetely get a feel for the longer you code.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: A class can inherint attributes and methods from another class.

2. React: React is a User Interface (library). It's a took for building UI components

3. React state - The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.

4. React lifecycle methods: These are methods built into Reach that act on components

5. DOM: (NOTE: I've seen these before when I was watching videos for projects. This was what they used.)
D-Document
O- Object
M-Mode
Documents has plenty of methods that we can use on DOM.
By using DOM you can access and update content, structure, and style of a document.
